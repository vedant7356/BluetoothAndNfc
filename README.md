Bluetooth and NFC Implementation in Android

Project Overview
This Android project demonstrates the implementation of Bluetooth and NFC technologies. The application is designed to showcase the capabilities of wireless communication and proximity-based data exchange using modern mobile devices.

Key Features
Bluetooth Connectivity: Discover and connect with nearby Bluetooth devices. This feature highlights the power of wireless communication by listing available devices and enabling connections.
NFC Basics: Implement NFC functionality to demonstrate quick and secure data exchange between devices. (Note: This feature requires an NFC-compatible device.)

Development Tools
Android Studio
Java

Emulators: Google Pixel 6 Pro (Android 12 and 13)

Challenges & Learning
One of the primary challenges encountered during development was the lack of NFC support on my physical Android device. To address this, I leveraged Android emulators to simulate NFC functionality and focused on perfecting Bluetooth connectivity.

Call for Collaboration
If you have an NFC-compatible Android device, your assistance in testing the NFC functionality would be invaluable. Please feel free to share screenshots or feedback.


Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the project.



I'm excited about the knowledge gained from this project, especially in navigating device-specific limitations and maximizing available tools. Thank you for checking out my project!
